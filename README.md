1. Format needs to be easily converted into html so we can post them on our website and farmers can view them over the internet.
2. Each page provides information for each specific farmer only (respect their privacy);
3. However, it should also be informative of how much worse or better they are doing relative to their neighbours (use summary statistics, e.g. means, variances, and percentiles).
4. Simple and easy to understand graphs will be excellent (e.g. histograms and radar plots).
